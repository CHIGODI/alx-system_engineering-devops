# Project 0x04: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview
This project focuses on mastering the use of loops and conditions in Bash scripting, along with parsing data. The tasks include creating an SSH RSA key pair, writing scripts using loops and conditions, and parsing Apache log files.

## Tasks

### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
- Generate an RSA key pair.
- Share the public key in the answer file `0-RSA_public_key.pub`.
- Add the public key to the intranet profile's SSH public key field.
- Keep the private key secure.

### 1. For Best School loop
- Write a Bash script using a for loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### 2. While Best School loop
- Write a Bash script using a while loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### 3. Until Best School loop
- Write a Bash script using an until loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### 4. If 9, say Hi!
- Write a Bash script using a while loop and an if statement to display "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, also display "Hi" on a new line.

### 5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
- Write a Bash script using a while loop and if, elif, and else statements to display different messages for specific loop iterations.

### 6. Superstitious numbers
- Write a Bash script using a while loop and a case statement to display messages for specific loop iterations.

### 7. Clock
- Write a Bash script to display the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a while loop.

### 8. For ls
- Write a Bash script using a for loop to display the content of the current directory in list format, showing only the part of the name after the first dash.

### 9. To file, or not to file
- Write a Bash script using if and else statements to check if a file exists, and print information about it.

### 10. FizzBuzz
- Write a Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 100, applying FizzBuzz rules.

### 11. Read and cut (Advanced)
- Write a Bash script using the read command to display specific information from the /etc/passwd file.

### 12. Tell the story of passwd (Advanced)
- Write a Bash script using a while loop and IFS to display information about users from the /etc/passwd file.

### 13. Let's parse Apache logs (Advanced)
- Write a Bash script using awk to display visitor IP addresses along with HTTP status codes from the Apache log file.

### 14. Dig the data (Advanced)
- Write a Bash script using awk to group visitors by IP and HTTP status code, displaying the occurrence number in list format, ordered from the greatest to the lowest.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting, along with tasks related to managing SSH keys and parsing Apache log files. The skills developed in this project are crucial for efficient script development and system administration.
