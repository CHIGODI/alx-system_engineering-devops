# Networking Basics Project

## Overview
Reinforce your understanding of networking concepts, covering OSI model, network types, MAC/IP addresses, UDP/TCP protocols, and more.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain OSI model, layers, and organization.
- Define LAN, WAN, and Internet.
- Understand MAC and IP addresses.
- Differentiate UDP and TCP protocols.
- Memorize common TCP/UDP port numbers.
- Implement Bash scripts for displaying listening ports and pinging IP addresses.
