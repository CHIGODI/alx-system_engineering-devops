# Project: 0x0B. SSH

## Description

This project is part of the ALX curriculum to teach the fundamentals of SSH
(Secure Shell) and how to configure SSH for secure remote access to servers.
The project covers topics such as creating SSH key pairs, configuring SSH client
settings, and understanding the basics of server administration and security.

## Tasks

1. **Use a private key**: Write a Bash script that connects to a server using
   SSH with a private key.

2. **Create an SSH key pair**: Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair
   for SSH authentication.

3. **Client configuration file**: Configure the local SSH client to use the
   private key and refuse password authentication.

4. **Let me in!**: Add a specified SSH public key to the server to enable remote
   access using the Ubuntu user.

5. **Client configuration file (w/ Puppet)**: Use Puppet to automate the
   configuration of the SSH client, setting it to use the private key and
   disable password authentication.
