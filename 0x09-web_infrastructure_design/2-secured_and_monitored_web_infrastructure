For every additional element, why you are adding it?
Firewall:
Added for enhanced security, controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic.

SSL(certificate)
Configured to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication.

Monitoring Clients
Collect data related to the performance, health, and security of the infrastructure.

What are firewalls for
enhance security, controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
ensures encrypted communication.

What monitoring is used for
Collect data related to the performance, health, and security of the infrastructure.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring tools collect data by actively or passively observing various aspects
of the infrastructure, including server performance metrics, error logs, and
security events. These tools may use agents installed on servers or collect data
remotely through APIs or log analysis.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
To monitor the web server's Queries Per Second (QPS), you can use the monitoring
tool to track the number of incoming requests over a specific time period.
Analyzing QPS helps understand server load and performance.

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer level exposes decrypted traffic
between the load balancer and servers, potentially compromising data security.

Mitigation: SSL termination should occur at the web servers, ensuring end-to-end encryption.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Issue: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is a single point
of failure for write operations.
Mitigation: Implement a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) MySQL cluster for redundancy
and failover.

Why having servers with all the same components
(database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Issue: Servers with identical components increase the risk of a widespread
failure affecting all servers.
Mitigation: Introduce diversity in server configurations, ensuring that a
failure in one component doesn't impact all servers in the same way.
