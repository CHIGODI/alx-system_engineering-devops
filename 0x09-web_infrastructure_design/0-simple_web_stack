SPOF(Single point of failure)?
On the design we only have one server, which is depended bythe whole infrastructure this poses
risk of downtime during server failure

Downtime when maintanance needed.
when maintanance is needed the server needs to be restartedin order to deploy new code hence causing
downtime

cannot scale up
the infrastructure cannot scale up because the server will because there is no redundant servers
one server can easily be overwhelmed by many requests.
