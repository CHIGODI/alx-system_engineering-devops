For every additional element, why you are adding it?
We are adding more server to ensure redandancy this will help solve problem of
downtime incase one server fails
we add a load balancer to help distribute traffic/reuqets to the servers

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it
works?
Round-robin algorithm - Just like the name suggets this algorithm distributes request
	    	   from one server to another and back in a circular manner
		   Each server in the pool is selected in turn to handle the
		   next request, and the cycle repeats.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain
the difference between both?
my design is enabling active-active
all servers work together distributing the load to server requests

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
The primary node (master) handles write operations, and changes are replicated
to the replica nodes (slaves) for read operations.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
The primary node handles write operations, while replica nodes are read-only
serving read queries and maintaining synchronization.

Where are SPOF
Location: The potential SPOF in the infrastructure is the load balancer (HAproxy).
Concern: If the load balancer fails, there's a risk of downtime since it is the
sole point responsible for distributing traffic among the servers.
Mitigation: To address this, a high-availability configuration for the load
balancer could be considered, where multiple instances are set up in a redundant
manner to ensure continued operation even if one instance fails.

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
No Firewall:
Concern: The absence of a firewall exposes servers and the database to potential
security threats, including unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
Mitigation: Implementing a firewall can help control and monitor incoming and
outgoing traffic, adding a layer of security to the infrastructure.

No HTTPS:
Concern: The lack of HTTPS poses a security risk during data transmission,
as data is transferred in plain text, susceptible to interception.
Mitigation: Configuring HTTPS ensures the encryption of data during transmission
preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure communication between clients
and the web server.

No monitoring
Lack of monitoring tools means there's no real-time visibility into the
performance, health, and potential issues of the infrastructure.
Monitoring is crucial for identifying and addressing issues promptly.
