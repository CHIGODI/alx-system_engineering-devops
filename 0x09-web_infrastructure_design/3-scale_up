You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it

Load-Balancer (HAProxy) as cluster:
If one HAProxy instance fails or becomes unavailable, another instance takes
over, ensuring uninterrupted service. This eliminates a single point of failure.

HA proxy - evenly distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers.
Benefits: High availability, fault tolerance, and improved performance.
Web Server, Application Server, Database:

each component on own server
Splitting these components onto separate servers provides modularity,
scalability, and fault isolation.
Benefits: Prevents a failure in one component from affecting others, allows
independent scaling, and enhances fault tolerance.
