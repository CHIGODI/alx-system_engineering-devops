# Project Title: Web Stack Debugging 1 - Dockerfile and Bash Script

## Description:
This project focuses on debugging issues related to Nginx setup in a Docker container. Two tasks are involved:

### Nginx Likes Port 80:
- Debugged Nginx setup to ensure it listens on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs.
- Wrote a Bash script (`0-nginx_likes_port_80`) to configure the server to meet the requirements.
- Verified script execution by curling port 80 and confirming Nginx response.

### Make it Sweet and Short:
- Enhanced the Bash script (`1-debugging_made_short`) from Task 1, ensuring it's 5 lines or less.
- Ensured script execution produces correct Nginx response.
- Confirmed Nginx service status shows it's not running after script execution.
