# Processes and Signals Project

This project explores process management and signals in Linux using Bash scripts and C programming. The tasks cover essential concepts such as PID, process listing, signal handling, and more.

## Task Overview

### 0. What is my PID
- Script: [0-what-is-my-pid](./0x05-processes_and_signals/0-what-is-my-pid)
- Displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes
- Script: [1-list_your_processes](./0x05-processes_and_signals/1-list_your_processes)
- Displays a list of currently running processes.

### 2. Show your Bash PID
- Script: [2-show_your_bash_pid](./0x05-processes_and_signals/2-show_your_bash_pid)
- Displays lines containing the word 'bash' along with their PIDs.

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy
- Script: [3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy](./0x05-processes_and_signals/3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy)
- Displays PIDs and process names for processes containing the word 'bash'.

### 4. To infinity and beyond
- Script: [4-to_infinity_and_beyond](./0x05-processes_and_signals/4-to_infinity_and_beyond)
- Displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely.

### 5. Don't stop me now!
- Script: [5-dont_stop_me_now](./0x05-processes_and_signals/5-dont_stop_me_now)
- Stops the process from Task 4 using the `kill` command.

### 6. Stop me if you can
- Script: [6-stop_me_if_you_can](./0x05-processes_and_signals/6-stop_me_if_you_can)
- Stops the process from Task 4 without using `kill` or `killall`.

### 7. Highlander
- Script: [7-highlander](./0x05-processes_and_signals/7-highlander)
- Displays "To infinity and beyond" and handles SIGTERM with "I am invincible!!!".

### 8. Beheaded process
- Script: [8-beheaded_process](./0x05-processes_and_signals/8-beheaded_process)
- Kills the process from Task 7.

### 9. Process and PID file
- Script: [100-process_and_pid_file](./0x05-processes_and_signals/100-process_and_pid_file)
- Creates a PID file, displays messages, and handles signals.

### 10. Manage my process
- Scripts: [101-manage_my_process](./0x05-processes_and_signals/101-manage_my_process), [manage_my_process](./0x05-processes_and_signals/manage_my_process)
- Manages a background process with start, stop, and restart functionalities.

### 11. Zombie
- C Program: [102-zombie.c](./0x05-processes_and_signals/102-zombie.c)
- Creates 5 zombie processes.

## Usage

For each script or program, follow the instructions in the respective task to execute and observe the behavior.
